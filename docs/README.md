# Documentation

Extended documentation for `easy-ffmpeg`. The project [README](../README.md) covers installation, usage, and a headline benchmark; the documents below go deeper.

## Index

| Document | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [**nvidia-acceleration.md**](nvidia-acceleration.md) | Full writeup of the `--gpu` flag added in v0.3.0 — when to use it, why Docker, why CUDA 12.8, the two-tier pipeline, encoder mapping, quality auto-tuning, the three `--gpu-quality` modes, HDR preservation, auto-deinterlace, batch processing, troubleshooting, and known limitations. |
| [**vr360.md**](vr360.md) | `--vr360` for 360 / spherical video: dewarp dual-fisheye to equirectangular, encode already-stitched files, single-lens fisheye support, FOV and resolution control, pipeline internals. |
| [**benchmarks.md**](benchmarks.md) | CPU vs GPU measurements on real content, methodology, how to reproduce on your own hardware, how to compute SSIM manually, NVENC / NVDEC capability differences by GPU generation. |
